# CTSNC

## Modules
### Use different modules to enchance CTSNC with additional features based on the server needs. 
Just download the latest release of the **Module** and put it into your plugins folder along the latest version of CTSNC and restart the server.
CTSNC will auto detect the module and expand its functions. 

Anything can be customized in the main CTSNC folder in the corresponding YAML file.
