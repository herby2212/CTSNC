## General
CTSNC, standing for **Custom Chat, Tablist, Scoreboard, NameTag & Chat**, is a all-round solution **based on multiple modules** each featuring a dedicated function while CTSNC acts as the core.
Here all configuration files are housed for easy management and customization.

CTSNC is not limited to the parts mentioned above by also including a **welcome system** incl. **titles & actionbar**, **over 1000 variables** by supporting many plugins and API's and other features that can be activated by adding a **module** listed below.

### Modules
### Use different modules to enchance CTSNC with additional features based on the server needs. 
Just download the latest release of the **module** and put it into your plugins folder along the latest version of CTSNC and restart the server.
CTSNC will auto detect the module and expand its functions.

**Currently existing modules**
* AntiDirectConnect - Prevent hackers from directly joining onto your server if the server is running in a BungeeCord network.
* Chat - Features a full fledged chat system incl. a staff chat and custom messages for several events like when a player joins.
* Christmas - Brings the christmas time to your server by letting it snow over the player, giving the player a santa head or turning water to ice under the players feet (of course customizable).
* DisplayName - Features a customizable name in the tablist for the player e.g. colored name and/or role prefix in front of the name.
* NameTag - Features the same as the DisplayName module, but in this case above the players head.
* Scoreboard - Features a full 48 character scoreboard and a animated title both fully customizable.
* Stats - Collects stats for multiple events user do on your server like a Death, Join, First Join, Block Breaking and more. (The collection of each stat can be enabled/disabled)
* Tablist - Features a customizable header and footer for the tablist.

**Each module supports the over 1000 variables of CTSNC.**

Anything can be customized in the main CTSNC folder in the corresponding YAML file.
